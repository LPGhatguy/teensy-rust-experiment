# Rust on Teensy 3.6
I'm reviving this project after a couple years of inactivity after hitting a brick wall trying to configure timers on the board. If all else fails, maybe I'll buy a Teensy 4.0 and see if there's more community support!

## Requirements
- Teensy loader CLI
- arm-none-eabi target and binutils

Run `./build` to build and deploy to a connected device.
